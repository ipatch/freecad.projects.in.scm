my first experiment with version controlling freecad project files

## workflow / 20 apr 2021

- setup a working dir, init a git repo within the working dir `git init`
- launch freecad, create a new document, save the document
  > a `project.FCStd` file will be created in the git repo
- make a change to the document, ie. add a cube or something (part workbench)
- save the document again, a `project.FCStd1` file will be created
